# cs150FinalProject
My first shot at writing a fully functional Java program. A user is allowed to sketch digits, and my program compares the sketched digit's RGB values against those fed into my own data set. 

If you have the Java SDK installed on your computer, go ahead and compile Project.java inside the folder that these files are in.

A popup with instructions will let you know what to do!
